# Kaggle-March-Madness

Code for Kaggle's March Madness Machine Learning Mania. Includes data cleaning and aggregation to produce seed-based scores for base predictions and hard-coded upset predictions. 

This bracket assumes Wisconsin going all the way, but you can easily replace the wis1 for whatever team you wish to hard-code as a winner. First bracket assumes Kentucky upset in Final Four and second one in the Elite 8.
